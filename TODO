- when searching also check dinerIds are able to book in that timeframe, there are not other reservations
- try to remove unsafe sql (directly passing argument to IN)
- utils tests
- add FKs 
- add indexes
- add cascade delete for reservations to diners_reservations
- verify datetime is in the future when creating reservation
- it may be the case where a reservation gets created diners other than logged in diner because he has another reservation, we need a force delete to delete those reservations
